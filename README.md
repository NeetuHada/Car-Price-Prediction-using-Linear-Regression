# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Description:
This project utilizes linear regression to predict car prices based on various features like mileage, age, and engine specifications. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed to build a predictive model that provides valuable insights into the factors influencing car pricing.
Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features for optimal model performance.
Model Implementation: Linear regression to establish relationships between car features and prices.
Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as R-squared, MAE, and RMSE to measure model accuracy.
Visualization: Graphical representation of insights and results.
Requirements:
Python (libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
